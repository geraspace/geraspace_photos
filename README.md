## Simple photo and simulation selling/review website for some of my favorite photos.
_### Tools: HTML, CSS and JavaScript/React.JS._

In this module I created React.JS _reusable components_ to show the image slideshow above and the small review cards below; I used the JavaScript **map()** method to import data from an external file and generate the personalized instances of the reusable component. 

I also practiced some conditional rendering to show the label _SOLD OUT_ and implemented media queries to improve the resolution on various devices.

I hope you like it.
